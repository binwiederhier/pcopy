# pcopy config file

# URL or hostname/port of the pcopy server.
#
# If only a HOST is given, the address is expanded to https://HOST:2586.
# If a HOST and a PORT is given, the address is expanded to https://HOST:PORT.
# If a full URL is given (starting with https:// or http://), the address is left unchanged.
#
# For servers: This address is advertised to clients. The server will still come up if the server address / URL
# is incorrect, but generated links may be incorrect.
#
# Format:    [http(s)://]HOST[:PORT]
# Default:   None
#
# ServerAddr

# Address and port to use to bind the server (HTTPS, HTTP and raw TCP). To bind to all addresses, you may omit the address
# and only pass the port, e.g. :2586. If no protocol suffix (/https or /http) is provided, /https is assumed.
#
# HTTP and HTTPS serve both Web UI and the curl-compatible API. The raw TCP socket only provides upload capabilities
# and needs either HTTP or HTTPS to provide download-capabilities.
#
# This is a server-only option (pcopy serve). It has no effect for client commands.
#
# Format:  [ADDR]:PORT[/(https|http|tcp)]
# Default: :2586/https
# Example: :443/https :80/http :9999/tcp
#
# ListenAddr :2586/https

# Default ID used when using the CLI without an ID. If this is left empty, a random ID will be chosen by
# the server. When this option is set in the server-side config, new clients will receive the default ID
# upon joining the clipboard.
#
# Format:  string consisting only of 0-9a-z.-_, but has to start with 0-9a-z
# Default: default
#
# DefaultID default

# If a key is defined, clients need to auth whenever they want copy/paste values
# to the clipboard. A key is derived from a password and can be generated using
# the 'pcopy keygen' command.
# 
# Format:  SALT:KEY (both base64 encoded)
# Default: None
#
# Key

# Path to the private key for the matching certificate. If not set, the config file path (with 
# a .key extension) is assumed to be the path to the private key, e.g. server.key (if the config
# file is server.conf).
#
# This is a server-only option (pcopy serve). It has no effect for client commands.
#
# Format:  /some/path/to/server.key (PEM formatted)
# Default: Config path, but with .key extension
#
# KeyFile

# Path to the TLS certificate used for the HTTPS traffic. If not set, the config file path (with
# a .crt extension) is assumed to be the path to the certificate, e.g. server.crt (if the config
# file is server.conf).
#
# For servers: This certificate is served to clients.
# For clients: If a certificate is present, it is used as the only allowed certificate to communicate
#              with a server (cert pinning).
#
# Format:  /some/path/to/server.crt (PEM formatted)
# Default: Config path, but with .crt extension
#
# CertFile

# Name of the clipboard as it is shown in the Web UI. This value is only used in the UI.
# Make sure it's not too long, or things may look ugly.
#
# This is a server-only option (pcopy serve). It has no effect for client commands.
#
# Format:  <string>
# Default: pcopy
#
# ClipboardName pcopy

# Path to the directory in which the clipboard resides. If not set, this defaults to 
# the path /var/cache/pcopy.
#
# This is a server-only option (pcopy serve). It has no effect for client commands.
#
# Format:  /some/folder
# Default: /var/cache/pcopy
#
# ClipboardDir /var/cache/pcopy

# Maximum total size of the entire clipboard (sum of all files). Zero disables this setting.
#
# This is a server-only option (pcopy serve). It has no effect for client commands.
#
# Format:  <number>(GMKB)
# Default: 0 (disabled)
#
# ClipboardSizeLimit 0

# Maximum number of clipboard files. Zero disables this setting.
#
# This is a server-only option (pcopy serve). It has no effect for client commands.
#
# Format:  <number>
# Default: 0 (disabled)
#
# ClipboardCountLimit 0

# Maximum size per uploaded clipboard file. Zero disables this setting.
#
# This is a server-only option (pcopy serve). It has no effect for client commands.
#
# Format:  <number>(GMKB)
# Default: 0 (disabled)
#
# FileSizeLimit 0

# Duration after which clipboard contents will be deleted unless they are updated before.
# There are three different flags controlled by this setting: the default time-to-live (TTL),
# the maximum TTL for non-text content, and the maximum TTL for text-only content.
#
# - default: defines the TTL used when the client does not specifically send a TTL
# - nontext-max (optional): defines the maximum allowed TTL for non-text content; to disable the max, set to 0
# - text-max (optional): defines the maximum allowed TTL for text-only content (up to 512 KB); to disable the max, set to 0
#
# If only one value is set, all values are set to the same value, e.g. "7d" translates to "7d 7d 7d".
# If two values are set, nontext-max and text-max are set to the same value, e.g. "7d 10d" translates to "7d 10d 10d".
#
# This is a server-only option (pcopy serve). It has no effect for client commands.
#
# Format:  default [nontext-max [text-max]] (space-separated durations; all values have the format <number>(s|m|h|d|w|mo|y))
# Default: 7d
# Example: 1mo 6mo 2y (default is 1 month, max for non-text is 6 months, max for text up to 512 KB is 2y)
#
# FileExpireAfter 7d

# Modes that are allowed to be set by the client for uploaded files, read-write ("rw") and read-only ("ro).
# If both modes are set, the client can chose. If no mode is set by the client, the first mode is used as
# a default.
#
# If you are primarily running a clipboard, using "rw ro" as a default makes the most sense.
# If you are running a nopaste, setting "ro" makes the most sense.
#
# This is a server-only option (pcopy serve). It has no effect for client commands.
#
# Format:  rw|ro [rw|ro]
# Default: rw ro
#
# FileModesAllowed rw ro
